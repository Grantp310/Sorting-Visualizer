## About

This web app was created as a learning tool for myself and others to better understand various sorting algorithms with a calm, aesthetically pleasing design.

The app grows the user's intuition for the runtime complexities of various sorting algorithms.

Current sorting options include:
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Bubble sort
